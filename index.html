        <p class="content-columnR">The most interesting part of this opening line (the first sentence in a seven book series, with each book getting
            progressively larger and more complex for the most part) is that it has nothing to do with our title character
            and (now) culturalicon, Harry Potter. Instead, the opening of Harry Potter deals exclusively with two minor characters
            - the Dursleys, Harry's aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon who adopt him after his parents' death at the hands of
            the evil wizard Voldemort.</p>
